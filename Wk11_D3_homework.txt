1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?

To pause the running code and launch the debugger.

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?

No.

3. How do we debug the next line of code?

Using the step over command.

4. What does the step into command do?

If the line contains a function the debugger will step into the function code and continue debugging there; otherwise (I think) it acts the same as step over.

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?

The former allows a single expression to be run on objects already created in the code, while the latter allows us to run multiple lines of code and create variables at the same time.
